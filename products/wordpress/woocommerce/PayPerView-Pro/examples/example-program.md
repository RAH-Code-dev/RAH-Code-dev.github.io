### Shortcode Usage

Use the following shortcode to display content based on the user's last completed order state:

```shortcode
[show_last_users_order_state state="true"]Your premium content goes here.[/show_last_users_order_state]
```

Replace `"true"` with the desired order state. The content will only be displayed if the condition is met.
